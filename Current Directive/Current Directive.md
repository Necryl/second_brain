if we are gonna change
we gotta fuckin change
it will be hard
it will be miserable
you won't have fun
you will not enjoy life
it will break your heart
it will break your ego
it will break your spirit

it will have to give birth to a new you
slowly you will forget who you were before
the proofs will build up to a new identity.
But the breaking away pain in the beginning will be terrible, horrible.
But the good thing about this new you, although it is someone who has no fun, is that he will have options. To actually choose who he wants to be.
Will I regret not enjoying life? Heck no. I have already wasted my childhood. And my "college" days. I want to help my family, my friends and other people. And if that's all I do, work, work, work.

I don't want this.
