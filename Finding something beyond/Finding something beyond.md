I have made this website in which I put a list of themes, and it tells me each day a theme of the day, by cycling through the list. Today's theme is finding something beyond.
This is about defining and discovering humanity's call. The call from beyond to something greater. I guess we perceive it as God.
When I think about and try to put a name on it, or describe the process or in some way try to make it understandable, believable, intellectually... not only do I fail, I feel like an imposter and a hypocrite every time. I am nobody, not even close to who I should be, to tell humanity what is its call. I am sorry.
But I want to probe this, I want to understand this and put it in words, so that it can be easily shared with others, and so that people may discover this sooner than later.

I don't know if I know enough, or if I will ever be enough to show people with proof that here is God, let's follow him. In a way that is not like "just believe in my book". But actually invite people to discover God for themselves. I want to do that, and I will try, and maybe it will be done.

For now what I do know, is that I seek something, which I think comes from God. Many people have nothing to seek beyond themselves, and thus the world is that much worse for that. So I would like to invite them all on a journey towards this thing I seek. That is pour oneself out, to love others and to solve problems. I feel like if everyone, committed their whole being to this purpose, we would all be better off and the world would be a better place, and we would all be closer to God, whoever or where-ever He is.

So for now my mantra is, Love others, Solve problems. And chase the light that calls you to this, that pulls you towards this future.
