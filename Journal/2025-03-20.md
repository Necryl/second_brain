So. I am feeling like I have been trapped. As in, I have lost. That all my ambitions were all just pipe dreams, and I sacrificed a good normal life for nothing. 


But who cares, nothing matters. I am gonna do what I can with what I have. And when I die, it will be a sweet relief. I wish everyone else a good life though, and I am sorry for all the hurt I have caused. 

Thank you everyone who tried to love me.


Also, I should stop saying "I will do this", "I will do that", when instead of saying "I will...", I should just be doing it, or shut the hell up!
