i am feeling terrible.
i realised i cannot do the work i need to do in the time available.
i am on a holiday, and I wanted to get a new job before it is time to return to my job.
as I make timetables ad stuff for it, and try to complete tasks on time i relaise i cannot. and this fills me with dread and i don't know what else.
for like 5 days I have been clean and stayed away from pornography. Now the urges are back with a vengeance, probably because the brain really wants a distraction from the pain.
no matter what distraction i get. even if I got a girlfriend and had the best sex ever, I would still need to get a new job and all  the work that needs to be done will still be here. so? bottomline, I need to work hard. Give it  my all and get myself in a position to look for jobs properly. say no to unnecessary things.
