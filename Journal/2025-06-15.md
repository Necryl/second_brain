I need
Inner peace: 
- Bhagavad Gita: This Hindu scripture is highly relevant, given your context in India. It teaches how to act selflessly (Karma Yoga) while maintaining inner equanimity through detachment from outcomes. Chapter 2, verses 47–48, emphasize doing your duty with full effort but without attachment to results. Read a translation by Eknath Easwaran or Swami Sivananda for clarity, available in bookstores or online (e.g., PDF versions from Gita Press)
- Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu: This Taoist text explores living in harmony with the flow of life, embracing stillness while acting effortlessly (Wu Wei). Stephen Mitchell’s translation is accessible and widely available online or in libraries.
- The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle: A modern guide to staying present, which helps you detach from mental noise and find peace in the moment. Available as an e-book or audiobook on platforms like Amazon Kindle or Audible.
- Action:
- 1. Meditate, detaching from external stuff
- 2. Read the above books
Confessions:
- In Christianity, sin is something that breaks the harmony/relationship you have with God, yourself, other people or nature. In confession you repent of the sin and make up with whoever/whatever, whose relationship you hurt by sinning.
- It is also super nice pouring your heart out to someone as to how you sinned and feeling someone else hold you and pull you back into the track.
- of course when another person is not available, there must be a way to do a kind of prayer to repent and confess.
- I need to find my person, who I can trust and confide in for this purpose. I think if I put out all my intentions in some content form that is digestible and send ex-Christians to it, I might find my person. This person can be make our female. The only requirement is they share the same purpose as me.
- Action: create the content > market to ex-christians who love the Christian culture but cannot believe.
