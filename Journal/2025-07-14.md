I want to be like Rick. Not because Rick is cool, but because I think that is the right way to be. He just inspires me and gives me insight into how I want to be.

SO what is Rick like? Why and which parts of him do I want to integrate into myself?:
1. He is always doing shit. Always active, pursuing something
2. And in that pursuit he is always in the moment. The path and future don't bother him except in how they might be relevant to whatever is needs to do NOW. But he is always living in the NOW.
3. He does one thing at a time, and makes all of his attention available to the present moment, as he does that ONE thing.
	When he is having fun, he is completely having fun. When he is dealing with something, he is completely dealing with that thing. When he is on a quest, he is completely on that quest. And he doesn't do two things at a time. When he is on mission he doesn't go trying to have fun "to take a break". One thing at a time.

So in conclusion, the traits I wanna embody is:
1. I want to be always doing something, actively
2. When I do it, I don't want to bother about the future or the past, just that one thing I am doing right now.
3. And I want to be doing only one thing at a time. I don't want to go of on a side quest in the middle of something. I finish this thing then go to do something else.

More laconically:
1. Always be doing something
2. Screw everything else except what I am doing
3. And I am not taking any breaks until I am done with it.
