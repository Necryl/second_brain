thank you storyteller, next


Welcome to Storytelling Practice,
Format is simple, we take turns telling stories. The story can be anything, from something simple like "my cat knocked the glass jar off the table yesterday", to something like The Odyssey. If you can't think of one, you can get a prompt to help you remember something to tell as a story.

### Questions to Help People Recall an Incident

If someone’s drawing a blank on a story, these open-ended questions can jog their memory by focusing on recent experiences or emotions. They’re designed to spark ideas without being too restrictive:

1. **What’s something small that made you smile or laugh recently?**
    - This prompts light, positive memories that are easy to share, like a funny moment with a friend or a quirky thing they noticed.
2. **Was there a moment this week when you felt surprised or caught off guard?**
    - Surprise often sticks in our minds, so this can uncover unexpected incidents, big or small.
3. **Did anything happen recently that felt like a tiny win or accomplishment?**
    - This helps people recall moments of pride or satisfaction, like finishing a task or helping someone out.
4. **What’s something you noticed or learned about someone or something around you?**
    - This encourages reflection on interactions or observations, like a conversation with a coworker or a new detail about their surroundings.
5. **Was there a time recently when you felt a bit frustrated or challenged?**
    - Negative emotions can lead to relatable stories, like dealing with a tech issue or a tricky situation.
6. **What’s a random thing you saw, heard, or did that stuck with you?**
    - This is great for low-stakes stories, like an odd encounter at the store or a weird food combo they tried.
