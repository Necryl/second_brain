Action will always be your friend.
Other people may walk over you and act like they don't see you.
Your family may not see you. Your friends may not see you. Strangers may not see you. But Action always acknowledges you. It always gives results, it always has consequences.
When I feel unseen, I will retreat into action and do things. It will always acknowledge me.
