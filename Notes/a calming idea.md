#### I am just a player and this is a game

Meditation is supposed to be about not engaging with any thoughts, but today an idea actually helped me meditate.

Usually when I try to meditate, I am bombarded by anxious thoughts about various things in my life. And then I try to focus on my breathing but it feels more like forcing down the thoughts than accepting everything as it's supposed to be.

But today there was an idea that made everything settle down. The idea is:

**I am just a player and this is a game.**

Because when you are in a game, you don't see the opponents as evil or unfair or see it with any other value judgement. They are just the challenge and the point of the game. It helps me accept everything as it is.

Ironically it was an idea that brought the peace I sought in meditation, where you are supposed to be detached from ideas.

Not saying meditation is not good, but sitting down to meditate and meeting every anxious thought with the attitude from this idea was very effective for me.
