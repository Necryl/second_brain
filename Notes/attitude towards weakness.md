You can be harsh towards weakness or weak people. Holding them up to a standard and forcing them to rise to the standard or be disregarded. A bit like the villain in horizon zero dawn, or some strong harsh people.
Or you can accept them where they are, and work with them to navigate situations, without urging them to grow stronger. A bit like Gandalf the Grey in The Hobbit.

The first method puts pressure on the weak, and that might make them stronger. But it can also be harsh and if the weak are not able to rise to the situation they will just be crushed.
the second method unlocks the latent potential in the weak, creatively using their uniqueness to manage the situation and achieve the goals. This might create a happier environment and give people a happier life, but it might make them complacent and stop them from growing stronger.

Ideally there should be a method where you are working with what there is while also growing in strength. Getting the maximum use out of the latent potential in everyone.
