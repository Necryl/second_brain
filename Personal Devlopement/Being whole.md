I was born a cell and I was free. I grew up rolling around and it felt good being me. But then one day the body sent a white cell and it asked me, "which cell are you?". You see I am a cell in the body and there is a role for me. I told them my role and it looked at me like I am crazy. "Are you not of this body?" it asked me. "We need heart cells, brain cells, kidney cells, but not whatever this is that you are describing." So I looked at his paper and and look at the types they needed. "Well, none of this is me" I told the white cell. "Too bad, you want to keep getting oxygen you better pick fast." So I chose a role. They took me to the place and I looked around. None of them are me but it's okay, I could do what they do. So I copied their moves. I did what they did. But I was losing myself. It was terrible. My heart gnawed at me, and they kept stretching me. And then I gave up. I stopped playing the role, but I also stopped getting my oxygen. but it felt good. I rebelled, I went my away. I did what I wanted. I was whole again, and myself. But I will need the oxygen. My supply would run out. So now I have to choose.
