This has always been my goal on the horizon. The Ideal. The one that fixes my mistakes. The one that makes me worthy of existence. The one that makes me worthy of believing in.
But The Ideal is also the one that makes me irrelevant. It is also the one that kills me and erases me from existence. Because my unworthy ass cannot stand in its light. But at least I can be the vessel through which it comes into this world.

Before The Ideal my heart weighs as much as two neutron stars.
Before The Ideal I cannot help but lower my head as my neck feels too feeble.
Before the Ideal I want nothing but to be replaced, out with the old and damaged and stale,
and Welcome the new star, infinitely more capable and ready to take on the world on my behalf.
But I am afraid inheriting my will might be its imperfection and downfall. I do not want that. Just replace me completely. Be what should be. Let me wither away into nothingness. Please come into existence, the superior me, and live your life. Serve the Light and shine forth your inner light.


#### Who is The Ideal?
- He is a machine. He is a problem solver. He wants nothing but to solve problems.
- He is cold. He accepts everything as it is. And makes his next move without hesitation.
- He is egoless. He doesn't see himself, only things before him and maybe only things to do.
- He does care. He cares about people, and only maintains himself to continue serving others. His love for people is unconditional and never ending. But he never stops doing to love. His doing is his love.
- He understands social dynamics. He can express himself intentionally to navigate the social space. But wooing people isn't his goal.
- He prioritises. And never loses sight of what is important. When an unfortunate harm is inevitable due to this, he pulls the trigger without hesitation and then doesn't hover around to feel sorry. He hopes for the best for that person and moves on instantly.
- He has no anxiety. He is whole. He lives in the now, the past and future don't bother him. And he never thinks to think. He just does and sometimes that involves thinking.
- And he is always doing.

All the forces that exist in this world, please come together and help me fulfil this dream.


#### The practicality:
- Focusing on an identity/personality, or a kind of person, and wanting to be so may not be the right way to go about this.
- Identity is an illusion. I AM just me, an infinite source of possibilities. I can be many things, The Ideal being one of them.
- But what I am (normal perspective I am) is what I do. That is my identity. So to become somebody else, I cannot. I cannot change my being into someone else, that isn't how it works. The being and the identity is the aftereffect of what I do. 
- Doing doesn't change based on who you are, but who you are changes based on what you do.
- So the right approach, is to do what The Ideal would do. When what I do changes, so does my being as a result.
- And that is how The Ideal can be born into this world.


#### The steps forward:
- I want to explore and experiment to figure out what my ideal is.
- Then I wanna explore with writing stories, trying to capture the ideal beyond just intellectual concepts.
- Then I wanna give it a name, so when I invoke its name, it will manifest in my heart.
- Then I want a connection with it that will fuel me and drive me towards becoming itself.
- Then I can just be and do things with my ideal at my side, making things clear and guiding me by the hand.
