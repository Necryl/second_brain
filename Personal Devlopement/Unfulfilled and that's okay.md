when you feel unfulfilled with yourself, when you think, you need to feel fulfilled, you need to make sure you are the good noble right person. Forget it. Leave it. Yes, just like that. Yes it feels incomplete. Imperfect. Divided and not whole. Be fine with it. It's fine to be in pieces. Because the thing that is incomplete does not matter at all. Let it be. Let yourself be incomplete. Let that conversation with yourself end right in the middle of a word. It's okay, that thing is not at all important. It's not bad, but it's also worthless.  Let that be interrupted and go do what needs to be done. Yes you will feel less alive. It's like you aren't there anymore, but don't be afraid. Let all that fade away. And let the action happen. This is what you want, even though you aren't there anymore to enjoy it. Let yourself be no more. Because when you are truly living, you are never gonna know it.
