The following is from a chat with Grok ai, when I was exploring why I was avoiding making the school website despite, it being completely within my capacity, and it being the key to accomplishing my goals. https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_8cd76e02-a369-4b75-8299-2c7946db0b25

You’re welcome! Here’s a short, clear summary of the key emotional and psychological factors behind your avoidance of the school website project, along with strategies to tackle them. Keep this list as a handy reminder of what’s going on and how to move forward.

### What’s Holding You Back
- **Resentment**: You feel weighed down by the school administration’s expectations, especially since they don’t seem to care about your well-being.
- **Loss of Joy**: Coding for this project feels like a chore, not the fun hobby it used to be.
- **Fear of Failure**: You’re worried this project will end up unfinished or disappointing, like past efforts (e.g., your novel or animation).
- **Avoiding “Growing Up”**: This project feels like a step away from free, playful creativity and toward adult obligations you’re not ready for.

### How to Push Through
- **Reframe It**: See the website as a way to show off your skills (e.g., for a portfolio) or as a personal challenge, not just a task.
- **Make It Fun**: Add something small and creative (like a fun feature) to bring back the joy of coding.
- **Take Small Steps**: Break it into bite-sized tasks (e.g., just sketch the layout first) so it’s less overwhelming.
- **Keep Creativity Alive**: Start a low-pressure side project for yourself to protect that playful spark.

This sums up what you’re dealing with and gives you a plan to tackle it. Hope it helps you get unstuck!
