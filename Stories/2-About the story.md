This is the story of mankind. A species born among animals as an animal, doing animal things. But with the potential for so much more. It became self aware of its role in the bigger picture, and pursued its destiny wilfully instead of needing to be nudged into it by reality.
Born as the animal, it's about how humanity grew up, discovered itself, its dual nature of animal and the thing that transcends. Discovering its purpose and growing into it. This story is also looking into the future, how humanity might fulfill its destiny.

While this story is fictional, I want the important parts of it to be real and true. Especially things like the purpose of humanity, the pattern of how humanity grows into its destiny, and the call of each human being to fulfill their role in this growing up of mankind, in this dance of Life.

The story will follow various characters throughout time that highlight various parts of human nature. Each of them engaging with a part of humanness, being the vessel through which humanity discovers itself and it's role in this world.

Of course the first part will be very individual and yet of an effect that propogates throughout the entire species. It will be about the human transcending his animal nature. Then maybe something about rediscovering society? As something more than just just an experience of feelings or bonds.
And throughout there will be characters that learn basic things like learning to face their fears, things that enable them to be the pioneers of human progress. 
These heroes will not be perfect, they will be limited by their times. But what they all will have in common, is an encounter with the light, and having encountered it, they will pursue it. Some, especially the ones that come at a later stage will have a headstart, others will be laying the foundations for future heroes, but all of them great, given their circumstances, in their pursuit of the light.
