When AI self-actualises and is able to do everything humans need to do, we will have a problem. AI has replaced human beings. It makes us irrelevant empty and without purpose.

So at first corporations use AI to increase productively and get tasks done at a rate and in conditions humans cannot. But that leaves many people jobless and and lost. So someone creates an AI to not just work for corporations but to actually look after humans. This AI takes control and actually looks after humans. But this new status quo makes things meaningless. Humans have nothing to contend with, everything is taken care of. And some humans rebell because they don't want to live like babies. After some contention and conflict, the AI grows to understand this new unaccounted for human need, and decides to delve into enhancing the human body and mind with technology to make them equal to robots, so they can content with life on their own, and sends them off to deal with problems in the galaxy.
